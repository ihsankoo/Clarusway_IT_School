Exploratory Data Analysis: Predicting Income Levels of US Citizens

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing US citizens by income levels and preparing a large dataset to create a predictive model. My objective was to understand the characteristics that influenced an individual's income and use this information to make predictions.

To accomplish this, I conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data. I utilized a variety of data visualization techniques to uncover insights and identified several key variables that had a significant impact on income levels.

Next, I prepared the data by cleaning and transforming it to ensure its suitability for modeling. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling continuous variables.

Finally, the data has been succesfully prepared to use in machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that could accurately predict the income levels of individuals based on their characteristics.

The results of this project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence income levels and demonstrated the potential for using predictive modeling to make informed decisions
